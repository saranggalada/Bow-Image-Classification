**Description:** Classification of Bow (weapon) images scraped from the web into 5 types using Transfer-learning and Fine-tuning of 3 popular CNNs - ResNet50V2, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121. Finally the best performing fine-tuned models of each are ensembled with majority-rule voting
**Results:** Achieved a maximum accuracy and weighted-F1-score of 0.91, with 10 epochs of training on a bootstrapped dataset of 810 images
